# Yarn Workpsace Repo for my [VIA Stack](https://medium.com/@bradpillow/the-via-stack-vue-ionic-appsync-bfc251ee6de6) blog posts on medium.com

## Install

- yarn

## Run

- in the various packages/apps, **yarn start** , to start the app/demo

## Note

These demos are for my various [VIA Stack](https://medium.com/@bradpillow/the-via-stack-vue-ionic-appsync-bfc251ee6de6) blog posts and are here in the form of a [yarn workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) (i.e. a "monorepo"). Most of the demos are standalone and you can just copy out the packages from the app folder and install and run in it, rather than using yarn workspaces. With that said, yarn workspaces/monorepos are awesome and you should learn how to use them. They are a great tool in your programming utility belt!
